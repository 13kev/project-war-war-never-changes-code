      Not for love, but for resources, territory and of course most importantly,
      for PRIDE AND PETTY NATIONAL CONFLICTS!

    This website is nothing but a open love-letter to one of my favourite game
    saga, the <b>FALLOUT</b> games. Im learning HTML5 and since I had to create
    a website I thought with myself "Why not make it a personal project about
    something I love?" and then Im working to make this sweet sweet child come
    to live. Welcome to this little den of gun freak, insane epic moments and
    funny outcomes of ways to deal with a Deathclaw trying to exterminate your
    wastelander ass!
